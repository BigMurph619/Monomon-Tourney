At the end of the tourney, whoever has the fastest time (confirmed with a clip) will earn 3 bonus tourney points. |

-Treat Cycling Road as a Dungeon the first time you enter. If you defeat all 6 trainers (INCLUDING THE PSYCHIC UNDERNEATH [in the trees by New Mauville]) you will earn 1 tourney point. You may still return to cycling road to defeat trainers and/or do your mach bike race times if you elect to leave to heal, etc. prior to defeating all trainers.


## Awards

Awards will be given to 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place finishers. The top 3 will be recognized in the Murphverse and will earn badges in the MurphMob discord. Additionally, there will be a bits "Pool". Award pool entrants are required to donate 500 bits to BigMurph619's channel to enter. Every 500 bits donated to my channel (through tourney start date) will add 300 bits (Murph Tax plus twitch tax) to the pool (viewers included) to be distributed out the Top 3 finishers. Example: if there are 10,000 bits donated, there will be 6,000 bits in the "Pool". Distributions will be 1st: 50%, 2nd: 30%, 3rd: 20%. Example: Pool of 6k... 1st: 3,000 bits, 2nd: 1800 bits, 3rd: 600 bits.

Goodluck Challenger.
